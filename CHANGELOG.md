# RELEASE LIST

Regular SemVer logic. Review the [release requirements](RELEASE.md).

## RELEASES

### 1.5.0
- Added a Recommend page with direct Chrome and Firefox store actions to open, copy, or share the extension link.
- Added Recommend as the last item in the extension panel and toolbar context menus.
- Removed the hidden shortcut launch and default scenario data.
- Fixed navigation-menu tooltips so they appear beside their icons.

### 1.4.1
- Made popup tooltips compact and readable across languages, with balanced wrapping and stable positioning when their text changes.

### 1.4.0
- Restored animated toolbar badge colors in Chrome and Firefox.
- Raised the minimum supported Firefox version to 140 because `data_collection_permissions` is supported from Firefox 140 (released June 24, 2025).

### 1.3.0
- Added 1.5× scenario execution speed between 1× and 2×
- Scenario names are edited and saved directly in the Manage menu; new recordings select the name for immediate typing
- Compacted the Manage menu: name, then repeat and speed side by side; secondary actions are icon-only buttons with tooltips
- Tooltips stay fully visible within the popup viewport
- Check mode starts from Manage as “View on screen without running” and closes the popup

### 1.2.15
- Replaced the scenario edit window with a Manage menu under each list entry (speed, rename, look without run, action list, visibility, mode, delete)
- Scenario rows are compact: play, repeat count, name, and Manage; mode and visibility icons and the favorite star are no longer shown in the row
- Recording saves immediately with a default name; a short confirmation animation highlights the new entry
- Rename and Action list open as small dedicated modals
- Check mode starts from Manage as “Look without run” and closes the popup
- Favorite/default control is temporarily hidden in the UI; shortcut default data is preserved

### 1.2.14
- Asks for page access only when you start the extension, instead of all websites and tabs upfront
- Recording, check, and execution stop when you navigate to a different site; navigation within the same site continues
- Removed the Shortcuts page and public hotkey documentation; shortcuts remain available as a hidden capability

### 1.2.13
- Prepared Chrome Web Store upload release

### 1.2.11
- Reduced expected popup fallback logs from warning level to debug level

### 1.2.10
- Hardened popup click-list and i18n HTML rendering against unsafe `innerHTML` (DOM API / allowlisted markup)

- Aligned Step mode and Visible / Stealth explanation copy across locales with the English meaning

### 1.2.8
- Centralized content-script injection files and added an extension structure consistency check

### 1.2.7
- Welcome pin hint is positioned from the viewport edge (no fixed inset)

### 1.2.6
- Refactored background to a single modular entry (`app/background/main.js`) for Chrome MV3 and Firefox 121+
- Goal: one complete background load path instead of a short `background.scripts` list plus a longer `sw.js` `importScripts` list
- Fixes Firefox loading a thinner background than Chrome (Welcome, context menu, and related modules were missing from `background.scripts`)
- Declares Firefox minimum version 121.0 to match the service worker + scripts fallback model
